These scripts are development scripts and ihave been lifted from our auto build process. They are proof of concept prototypes to test feasibility.

Issues are spooled into:

./build/DigiMag_Base/magazine/

e.g. 

images/
magazine.xml

Scripts require ImageMagick to be installed, we currently use ImageMagick-x86_64-apple-darwin10.4.0.
